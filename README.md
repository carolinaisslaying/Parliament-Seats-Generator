# Pāremata Aotearoa (New Zealand Parliament) Seatmap Generator
Allows you to generate a seat diagram of the Aotearoa New Zealand parliament with party seats shown.

## Criteria for party inclusion
Every party that gained over 0.813% of the vote in the 2023 general election is included in the list of parties (presets). Nothing prevents you from manually adding your own custom party, these are just there for ease of use in adding popular parties.

The equation is as follows:

![Threshold percentage = (1 ÷ Total number of seats) x 100](https://i.imgur.com/On2zKeY.png)

And an example of the equation applied to the 54th Parliament elected by the 2023 general election:
![Threshold percentage = (1 ÷ 123) x 100 ≈ 0.813](https://i.imgur.com/Cs3RcB9.png)

## Example
Here is an example of the paged filled out, showing the current Aotearoa New Zealand parliament layout after the 2020 general election.

The party colours area is there just for ease of use, if you need a certain party's colour you can look at that and type it in.
